# Kovaaks-Playlist-Manager
Start the program add set the path to your steam folder.
If you have multiple steam libraries choose the one where you installed Kovaaks to.


Now you can add Playlists via drag&drop on the window. If you want to delete a playlist, select it in the browser and press the delete button.

I will probably improve the app in the future, if we dont get a tool like that from kovaaks himself.
